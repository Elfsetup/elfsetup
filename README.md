Linstaller
=================================

A Simple Fast Standalone Installer for Elementary OS.
-----------------------------------------------------

Linstaller can create a standalone distribution file
for Elementary OS for all binary executables and your
config and database files.

At moment, executable with dependecies other that build-in
in Elementary OS are not available.

But you can install all executable and your files with:
A Vala Executable (based in Gobject, Glib, Gtk2 or Gtk3, Gstreamer, etc)
A AppImage Executable (Simplify the Install and Uninstall Process if you like installed)
A Static Executable and all files needed by Executable.


At glance, try a test!:
---------------------------
Download the demo installer MyApp-v1.0
set
$ chmod +x ./MyApp-v1.0
and run.
